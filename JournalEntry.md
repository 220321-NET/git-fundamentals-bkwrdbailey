I learned today how to work in a shell via a CLI interface to move around a file system and make changes to it like creating a new file or a new directory/folder.
I also learned how to work in a local repository using git bash to create a repo, clone a repo from a remote storage site like GitHub, and to make push any changes/commits made to it to the remote site as to have a backup of it incase anything happens to the local repository.
I feel that I need to practice working with git bash more often as I have been using Github's desktop app to make commits to my remote repo as it has a simplified GUI interface.
With this all said I am excited to see what comes next on day two of my training!
