I learned today about working in a shell via a CLI interface to be able to make changes to a file system like adding new files or directories and removing them as well.
Another thing I learned today is how to use git bash to create a local repo or pull a repo from a remote site like GitHub to make changes that could then be push make to the remote repo as to have different versions being kept up to date for upkeep sake.
However, I have been used to working with GitHub's desktop app, which has a GUI interface, so getting used to typing out everything I want done will take me a while to get used to, but will be worth it in the end!
